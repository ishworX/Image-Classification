# Image-Classification
Image Classification Using CNN


Q1. What question are you going to address?
My question of interest is that, can we build a Neural Network Model that can predict Chess Pieces? I want to see if it's possible to create a model which can predict the Chess Pieces accurately since King and Queen look very similar. Also I am using a very small dataset and I will be testing different models and compare them to see the effect of depth & complexity of the model. The third question is that, will the pretrained model boost the model's predictive ability?

Q2. Define the problem as a supervised learning task, and how you will solve it using machine learning.
I am predicting the Chess Pieces from the Image Dataset. So I am using Supervised Learning and Multi Class Classification. First I will be making a Dense Model and then a Convolutaional Neural Network Model. After that I will try Pretained Model and will be using the best Model for Testing the predictability.
